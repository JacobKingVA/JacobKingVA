I'm passionate about cybersecurity and IT and I love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I’ve put into enhancing security operations and processes! I currently have earned the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications and am looking to continue to grow through ongoing projects, further certifications, and employment in the areas of IT and cybersecurity!
